# Python dependencies for RBC Security integration
#
# Note: rbc_security is installed separately on RBC work computers
# It's an internal RBC package not available on PyPI
#
# On RBC work computers, install with:
#   pip install rbc_security
#
# This proxy will work without rbc_security (uses fallback SSL config)
# but for RBC corporate network access, rbc_security is required.
